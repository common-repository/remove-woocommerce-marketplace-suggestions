**Remove Marketplace Suggestions for WooCommerce** is a quick and easy solution to doing exactly what it says - removing the unwanted Marketplace Suggestions from your WordPress admin. Just install and go!

== Description ==

WooCommerce's inclusion of **Marketplace Suggestions** is one of the more unpopular additions coming in WooCommerce 3.6. Suggestions for other plugins to buy can crop up constantly when viewing product lists, creating & editing products and in other places. They will crop up _daily_ and return unbidden after a month - _even if you dismiss them_. The purpose of this short n' sweet plugin is to **banish them entirely**.

For web developers & seasoned programmers it can be straightforward to add a filter to mitigate this; but for people who aren't comfortable with editing their site's code, or don't have the access or opportunity to do so, this plugin will take care of it for you.

= How does it work? =

Simple - just install the plugin & **bam!** - you're done. No setup, no extra configuration.
